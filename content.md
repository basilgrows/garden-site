‘Garden of Astral Blooms’ is a set of alien ecosystems developed for audiovisual performance. The songs are environments of ruin and wonder, each one a distorted and strange celebration of nature’s beauty. The visions are practices in optimism, reverent poems to a planet that supports life and has a dizzyingly uncertain future.

‘Garden of Astral Blooms’ is a set of alien ecosystems envisioned as audiovisual environments. They document scenes of ruin and wonder, each one a distorted and strange celebration of nature’s beauty. The visions are practices in optimism, reverent poems to a planet that supports life in a delicate and uncertain balance.


Sunlit Glass - sharp shapes cut through a giant sphere // colored glass in a meadow

Outgrate - out the tunnel, through the grate, away from the goo // higher above the ocean

Crag - around the mountain with glowing cracks // rocks burst, avalanche 

Frozen Veil - industrial debris clutter // an icy crater hanging in the sky

Pipelines - pillars tremble in a dark room // pipes lit from within

Tumbling Forward - iridescent clouds, swirling chaos blankets // jade trees fracture

Scorched Earth - steel structures flicker behind luminous monoliths //  charred ruins

Fragile Abundance - diffuse vocals sing to organisms // moments before disintegrating
